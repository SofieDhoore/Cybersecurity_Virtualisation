# Break the Clone

Warning! Disconnect the VM from any network.

First, you need the open the network connection again, to access the internet and download malware for testing. This malware can be found on the Malware Bazaar. After the download, close your VM and disable the network again.

In my download folder, I've unpacked the zip-file. But I needed to to try a few times, because my VM kept blocking the file.

I also needed to allow the threat in my Virus & Threat protection, there you can see the Trojan Horse I've downloaded.

I played some games and started a notebook but I didn't see something happening. After two times 15 minutes of waiting, I decided to reboot my VM as said in the labo. After the reboot he couldn't find my operating system.
