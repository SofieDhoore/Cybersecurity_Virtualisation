**Is 7-zip installed on the VM?** No.

**Is the antivirus software disabled?** No, it is enabled.

**Can you find any traces of the test malware or HermeticWiper on the VM?** No, the download folder where I've stored the testfile and the malware is empty. HermeticWiper isn't an allowed threat anymore.

**Is the VM working as it should?** I guess so.
